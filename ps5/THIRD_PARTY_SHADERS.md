# Third-party CRT shaders

FBNeo PS5 draws its CRT shaders on the CPU (`coreorbis/orbis-shims/ProsperoCrt.cpp`). Apart from
"CRT Easymode style", which is original code written for this port, they are C++ rewrites of shaders from
libretro's slang-shaders collection (https://github.com/libretro/slang-shaders, folder `crt/`), kept with their
default parameters. Their authors and licences follow.

| Shader | Source in slang-shaders | Author | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| crt-lottes | `crt/shaders/crt-lottes.slang` | Timothy Lottes | public domain |
| crt-lottes-fast | `crt/shaders/crt-lottes-fast.slang` ([CRTS] 20180120b, adapted for RetroArch by hunterk) | Timothy Lottes | Unlicense (public domain) |
| crt-1tap | `crt/shaders/crt-Ntap/crt-1tap.slang` (v1.4) | fishku | public domain (CC0) |
| crt-2tap | `crt/shaders/crt-Ntap/crt-2tap.slang` (v1.0) | fishku | public domain (CC0) |
| monoCRT | `crt/shaders/monoCRT.slang` | hunterk | public domain |
| newpixie-mini | `crt/shaders/newpixie-mini/newpixie-mini.slang` (adapted for slang by hunterk) | Mattias Gustavsson | Unlicense or MIT (used here under the Unlicense) |
| crt-hyllian-fast | `crt/shaders/hyllian/crt-hyllian-fast.slang` (ported to GLSL/slang by DariusG & hunterk) | Hyllian | MIT |
| crt-nobody | `crt/shaders/crt-nobody.slang` | Hyllian | MIT |
| crt-blurPi | `crt/shaders/crt-blurPi.slang` | Oriol Ferrer Mesià (armadillu) | MIT |
| ScaleFX (passes 0-4) | `edge-smoothing/scalefx/shaders/scalefx-pass0..4.slang` | Sp00kyFox | MIT |
| rAA post-3x (passes 0-1) | `anti-aliasing/shaders/reverse-aa-post3x/` (after Christoph Feck's reverse antialiasing) | Sp00kyFox | MIT |

"CRT Easymode style" follows the look of EasyMode's crt-easymode (`crt/shaders/crt-easymode.slang`, GPL) but
contains none of its code: the GPL can't be combined with FBNeo's licence.

"ScaleFX + rAA + AA style" is libretro's preset `presets/scalefx-plus-smoothing/scalefx+rAA+aa-fast.slangp` up to
its anti-aliasing: ScaleFX and rAA post-3x as above. The preset's last three passes are not included -- FXAA
(NVIDIA: its notice gives no permission to copy), guest(r)'s AA shader 4.0 and deblur (GPL, which FBNeo's
licence can't take in) -- and original code with the same purpose takes their place.
