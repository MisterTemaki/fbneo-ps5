# FBNeo PS5 2.2 (final review): the app's PIE must not call any function of the SDK's libc.a(syscalls.o). That member
# is the payload SDK's own system calls -- each one a bare "mov $n, %rax; syscall; ret" -- for payloads; a title's code
# goes through libkernel's exports (the stubs), and a raw system call from the eboot's own code may be refused by the
# console (SIGSYS) and never sets errno. 2.2's first build took link() from it (libkernel.so's stub has no link, only
# libkernel_sys has, which the app may not load): tools/check_imports.py can't see that, the code is static.
#
# The Makefile links the PIE with "-y <symbol>" for every symbol syscalls.o defines (lld then prints who defines and who
# references each one) and gives this the trace:
#
#   check_syscalls.py rsp <libc.a> <out.rsp>      writes the "-y <symbol>" lines (a response file for the link)
#   check_syscalls.py check <trace>               exit 1 when an object other than syscalls.o references a symbol
#                                                 that syscalls.o ends up defining (the member was linked in for it)
#
# A symbol syscalls.o defines but a stub defines too (and wins) has no "definition" line from syscalls.o unless the
# member was pulled in; only "lazy definition" lines, which are fine.
